    This example shows the problems arising with aliasing.
    While f is perfectly correct, if we were to declare a pointer like this:
      ^int x = new int;
    and use it in the following statement:
      f(x, x);
    then the program should display:
      - "The dereferenced pointer x^ is used after deletion."

    void f(^int x, ^int y) {
        delete x;
